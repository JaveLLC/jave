# Jave Language

Jave is a language predicated on the idea of human readable code as conversation.

We apologize if we are not 100% consistent yet, you can usually expect the longer form version of a line to be the correct one if you are confused.

### Jave Language Basic Constructs

#### Assignment:
This readme is using short variable names for ease of reading, however the Jave specification demands first names and surnames for variables.

eg.

```
Tim.Heidecker is identical to the value of 5
```


```
x is identical to the value of5
```

#### Conditional
```
is x identical to 1 ?
  y is identical to 3
or is x identical to 2 ?
  y is identical to 1
nope?
  y is identical to 4
fin
```

#### While loops:
```
during x being less than identical to 10 engage
  x is identical to x plus the value of 1
fin
```

#### Mathematical functions
Just an overview
```x is identical to x plus the value of 5
x is less than and or equal to the value of 5
x is greater than and or equal to the value of 5
x is extremely identical to 5
x is identical to 5
x is somewhat like but not identical to 5
x is identical to the value of x multiplied by the identical value of 5
x is identical to the value of x after subtracting the value of 5
```

Advanced while loop with array assignment
```
y is identical to an array of values consisting of 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0
during x being less than identical to the value of 10 engage
  y in the position of x is identical to the value of x plus the value of y
  x is identical to the value of x after adding the value of 1
fin
```

#### Objects and Arrays
```
Albus.Dumbledore is identical to a group of intrinsically related values consisting of 
    Sonny.Moore which contains an array values consisting of 0 and 0 and 1 
as well as 
    Dorian.Gray which contains an array of values consisting of 0 and 1 and 0
that is all
```

#### Pointers
Lots of work to be done here

`☞` is a pointer.

`☛` is a super pointer.

```
Simon.Simpson is an important figure that prescribes the intrinsic capability of representing the values of Name which is represented by the concept of ☞strings and Age which is represented by the concept of ☞integers

Amanda.Coletrain is identical to the value of ☛Simon.Simpson with the preference of Name being identical to Johhny and the preference of Age being identical to 25
