# Jave Language
From the Orca's blowhole, Jave is born. Jave is an open source compiled and interpreted language that makes it exceptionally difficult to build complex, unreliable, and inefficent software.

## Introduction
Jave, inspired by decades of technological process, seeks to utilize only the most intelligent, inspired, and significant processes in order to acquire completion of tasks at the speediest and most resiliant rate.

## Compiled or Interpreted?
Both! Would you believe it?
Due to innovations in Jave's framework, you write in raw Jave, which is then compiled into Signed Jave Intermediary language, a language you cannot write yourself but must be compiled by a licensed Jave compiler. This is then interpreted server-side, then delivered into the JaveVM for final compilation, linking, and operation.

#### Objects and Arrays
```
Albus.Dumbledore is identical to a group of intrinsically related values consisting of 
    Sonny.Moore which contains an array of values consisting of 0 and 0 and 1 
as well as 
    Dorian.Gray which contains an array of values consisting of 0 and 1 and 0
that is all
```

#### Pointers
Lots of work to be done here

`☞` is a pointer.

`☛` is a super pointer.

```
Simon.Simpson is an important figure that prescribes the intrinsic capability of representing the values of Name which is represented by the concept of ☞strings and Age which is represented by the concept of ☞integers

Amanda.Coletrain is identical to the value of ☛Simon.Simpson with the preference of Name being identical to Johhny and the preference of Age being identical to 25
