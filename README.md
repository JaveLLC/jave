### Jave Language Basic Constructs

#### Assignment:
```
x is identical to 5
```

#### Conditional
```
is x identical to 1 ?
  y is identical to 3
or is x identical to 2 ?
  y is identical to 1
nope?
  y is identical to 4
fin
```

#### While loops:
```
during x being less than identical to 10 engage
  x is identical to x plus the value of 1
fin
```

#### Mathematical functions
Just an overview
```x is identical to x plus the value of 5
x is less than and or equal to the value of 5
x is greater than and or equal to the value of 5
x is extremely identical to 5
x is identical to 5
x is somewhat like but not identical to 5
x is identical to the value of x multiplied by the identical value of 5
x is identical to the value of x after subtracting the value of 5
```

Advanced while loop with array assignment
```
y is identical to an array of values consisting of 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0
during x being less than identical to the value of 10 engage
  y in the position of x is identical to the value of x plus the value of y
  x is identical to the value of x after adding the value of 1
fin
```
